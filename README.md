# Haiku Generator Guided by ChatGPT

This project illustrates the development of a Haiku Generator using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What makes this project special is its guidance: the entire implementation was dictated by three exact prompts posed to ChatGPT. This showcases not only the Haiku Generator's capability but also the potential of AI-assisted programming via precise prompt engineering with ChatGPT.

## Exact ChatGPT Prompts Used:

The entire implementation journey was directed by the following three prompts:

1. **"Create three JavaScript arrays to serve as the foundation for a haiku generator. Each array will represent one line of the haiku. The first and third arrays should be populated with 5-syllable phrases, while the middle array should have 7-syllable phrases. Ensure that all phrases are themed around coding in JavaScript."**

2. **"Using the phrases from the arrays, how can you programmatically assemble them in JavaScript to form a complete haiku?"**

3. **"How can you implement a button in JavaScript that, when clicked, generates a haiku using the phrases from the provided arrays?"**

## Emphasizing The Learning:

This initiative goes beyond merely generating haikus. It stands as a testament to the power of **prompt engineering**. It highlights how, with clear and specific prompts, AI can be an invaluable aid in deconstructing and executing complex tasks.
